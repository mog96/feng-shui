# Feng Shui: Flow of Energy
LED art installation for the City of Palo Alto Code:ART Festival, June 1-3 2017.

In November 2016 the City of Palo Alto Public Art Program made an open call for proposals to reframe nine different sites in the city's downtown. In January 2017 I submitted a [proposal](https://github.com/mog96/feng-shui/blob/master/Proposal/README.md) for a public artwork to be installed on a street-facing stairwell of the public parking garage located at Bryant Street and University Avenue in downtown Palo Alto. In February 2017 I was awarded a grant of $3,800 to construct and install the work.

Below is documentation of the art installation.

This project would not have been possible without the dedicated time and energy of Steve Clark, who advised me on the design and engineering of this work. Steve is the manager of Stanford's Maker Space for electrical engineering, [lab64](https://ee.stanford.edu/student-resources/lab64), where I spent most of my weekends from February to June 2017 learning about electricity, designing components, and bringing this idea to life.
