# Feng Shui
Proposal for an installation at the City of Palo Alto Code:ART Festival, June 1-3 2017.

This LED tree form is tentatively titled _Feng Shui_, shown above in its daytime form. By night, the upper lights shift to starlight colors.

This installation would activate the street-facing stairwell of the public parking garage located at 455 Bryant Street, Palo Alto, by illuminating it day and night to create a sheltered, communal experience for pedestrians using the stairwell. The form represents a connection between the cloud and the Internet and our physical world, and its tree-like shape references the 'tall tree' that is Palo Alto—the tech-forward heart of Silicon Valley. The use of "feng shui" in the installation’s tentative title comes from the piece’s attempt to physically capture the impact of technology on the ambient energy of our human environment, given its now ubiquitous presence in our world today. The gentle lighting of the piece is symbolic of the gentle nature of our interaction with technology applications.
